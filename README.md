# YOLOv2 using Caffe
This is an implementation for converting YOLOv2 from [DarkNet](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/) to Caffe, with the option to convert Leaky ReLU to default ReLU instead. It is a minimal fork of [this repo](https://github.com/nodefluxio/caffe-yolov2), and existing code has not been complemented with any docstrings or comments if they were missing.

For the original YOLOv2 paper, see: ["Redmon, Joseph, and Ali Farhadi. â€œYOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger." arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.08242 (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242).

## What's inside
- YOLO to Caffe model converter (thanks to [Duangenquan](https://github.com/duangenquan/YoloV2NCS)).

## Supported models
Tiny YOLOv2: [cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/e84933bfdd7315736c442a41d9aed163843dda54/cfg/yolov2-tiny.cfg) and [weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/tiny-yolo-voc.weights)

YOLOv2 without Reorg and Route layers, without weight conversion: [cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/e84933bfdd7315736c442a41d9aed163843dda54/cfg/yolov2-voc.cfg)

This converter does not support `Route` and `Reorg` layers.

## Getting started
**NOTE** The following instructions assume that you already have a running Caffe v1.0 distribution in Python (see [here](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) for instructions). Optionally you may make use of the `Dockerfile` included in this repo, see instructions for usage below.

1. Download the pre-trained YOLO models (config file `.cfg` and pre-trained weights `.weights`).

2. Convert the config file using `create_yolo_prototxt.py`:
```
python create_yolo_prototxt.py -c CFG_INPUT -m PROTOTXT_OUTPUT [--noleaky for replacing Leaky ReLU with ReLU activation]
```

3. Convert the pre-trained weights using `create_yolo_caffemodel.py`:
```
python create_yolo_caffemodel.py [-h] -m PROTOTXT_INPUT -w WEIGHTS_INPUT -o CAFFEMODEL_OUTPUT
``` 

### Setup with Docker
Build a Docker image with a minimal Caffe 1.0 installation, using the `Dockerfile` inside this repo:
```
docker build --network=host -t caffe-cpu18.04 .
```

Then create a Docker container based on this image and open a terminal inside:
```
docker run -v $PWD:/workspace --net=host -it caffe-cpu18.04 /bin/bash
cd /workspace
python3 create_yolo_prototxt.py [with arguments from above]
python3 create_yolo_caffemodel.py [with arguments from above]

```

## Disclaimer
Please note that unlike DarkNet, Caffe does not support default padding in their pooling layers. Depends on your model, you might find a difference in the output size. In our case of tiny-yolo-voc, Darknet produces 13x13x125 output whilst Caffe produces 12x12x125.
